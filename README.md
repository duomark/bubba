Bubba (Benchmarking Using Browser-Based Animation)
==================================================

Bubba leverages [erlang](https://github.com/erlang/otp), [elli](https://github.com/knutin/elli) and [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) to animate and compare the execution of different algorithms. Initially, it measures embedded erlang code but the design allows calling out to other languages using erlang NIFs.

Bubba is released under the New BSD Simplified license.
